### Subtasks

1. **Define Domain Model**
- Identify and define the core entities: `Book`, `Author`, and `Genre`.
- Create value objects and aggregates as needed.

2. **Create Repositories**
- Define repository interfaces for `BookRepository`, `AuthorRepository`, and `GenreRepository`.
- Implement in-memory or mock repositories for initial testing.

3. **Implement Use Cases**
- Create use cases for searching books by title, author, and genre.
- Ensure use cases adhere to the single responsibility principle (SRP).

4. **Develop Application Services**
- Implement application services to handle the search logic.
- Ensure services are decoupled from the domain model.

5. **Design Adapters**
- Create input adapters (e.g., REST controllers) to handle user requests.
- Develop output adapters (e.g., database access) to interact with the repositories.

6. **Set Up Dependency Injection**
- Configure dependency injection to manage the lifecycle of services and repositories.
- Ensure that dependencies are injected rather than hard-coded.

7. **Implement Search Functionality**
- Develop the search functionality in the application services.

8. **Write Unit Tests**
- Create unit tests for domain models, repositories, and use cases.
- Ensure high test coverage and adherence to the open/closed principle (OCP).

9. **Integrate with Frontend**
- Develop API endpoints for the search functionality.
- Ensure the frontend can interact with the backend seamlessly.

10. **Refactor and Optimize**
- Continuously refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.
- Optimize the search functionality for performance.

11. **Document the Code**
- Write comprehensive documentation for the codebase.
- Ensure that the documentation is clear and helpful for future developers.
