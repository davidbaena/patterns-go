#### Step 3: Design the Solution
**Prompt:**
- "Outline the architecture and design for the solution in the bookstore system. What components and modules will you need?"
- "How will the components interact with each other? Provide a high-level overview."
- "Which design patterns or principles will you apply to ensure the solution is maintainable and scalable?"

**Prompt Example:**
Design SOLID principles and CLEAN CODE, the first 5 subtask. Do not implement code.

### Architecture and Design for Book Search Feature

#### Subtasks 1-5: Design Overview

1. **Update the Book Model**
2. **Modify the Database Schema**
3. **Implement Backend Search Logic**
4. **Create Search API Endpoints**
5. **Update the User Interface**

### Components and Modules Needed

1. **Book Model**
   - **Description:** Represents the book entity with attributes like title, author, and genre.
   - **Principles:** Apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to ensure the model only handles book-related data.

2. **Database Schema**
   - **Description:** The database structure that stores book information.
   - **Principles:** Use the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) to allow the schema to be extended without modifying existing structures.

3. **Backend Search Logic**
   - **Description:** Handles the logic for searching books by title, author, and genre.
   - **Principles:** Apply the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) to create specific interfaces for different search criteria.

4. **Search API Endpoints**
   - **Description:** Exposes endpoints for the frontend to request search results.
   - **Principles:** Use the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

5. **User Interface**
   - **Description:** The frontend component that allows users to input search queries and view results.
   - **Principles:** Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to ensure each UI component has a clear responsibility.

### High-Level Interaction Overview

1. **User Interface (UI)**
   - Users interact with the UI to input search queries.
   - The UI sends search requests to the Search API Endpoints.

2. **Search API Endpoints**
   - Receives search requests from the UI.
   - Calls the Backend Search Logic to process the search queries.

3. **Backend Search Logic**
   - Processes the search queries by interacting with the Database Schema.
   - Retrieves the relevant book data based on the search criteria.

4. **Database Schema**
   - Stores and retrieves book data.
   - Provides the necessary data to the Backend Search Logic.

5. **Book Model**
   - Represents the book data structure used throughout the system.

### Design Patterns and Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Ensure each class and module has one responsibility, making the system easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Design the system to be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing new features to be added without altering existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Ensure that derived classes can be substituted for their base classes without affecting the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Create specific interfaces for different functionalities, avoiding large, monolithic interfaces.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, promoting loose coupling and flexibility.

6. **Repository Pattern**
   - Use repositories to abstract the data access logic, making the system more modular and testable.

7. **Service Pattern**
   - Encapsulate business logic within services, promoting separation of concerns and reusability.

8. **RESTful API Design**
   - Follow REST principles for designing the API endpoints, ensuring they are stateless, scalable, and easy to consume.

By applying these principles and patterns, you can ensure that the book search feature is maintainable, scalable, and easy to extend in the future. If you need further details or have any questions, feel free to ask!
