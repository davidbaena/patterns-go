**Subtasks for Implementing User Registration and Authentication:**

1. **Define Domain Models and Value Objects**
    - Create domain models for `User` and value objects for `Email` and `Password`.
    - Ensure that the domain models encapsulate business rules and validations.

2. **Create Repositories Interfaces**
    - Define interfaces for user repository to handle user persistence.
    - Ensure the repository interfaces follow the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

3. **Implement Repository Adapters**
    - Implement the repository interfaces for the chosen database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
    - Ensure the adapters follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

4. **Define Use Cases (Application Services)**
    - Create use cases for user registration and authentication.
    - Ensure the use cases encapsulate the application logic and follow the Open/Closed Principle (OCP).

5. **Implement Use Cases**
    - Implement the user registration and authentication use cases.
    - Ensure the use cases interact with the domain models and repositories.

6. **Create Controllers (Adapters)**
    - Define controllers to handle HTTP requests for registration and login.
    - Ensure the controllers follow the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).

7. **Implement Controllers**
    - Implement the controllers to handle user registration and login requests.
    - Ensure the controllers interact with the use cases.

8. **Define and Implement Security Services**
    - Create services for password hashing and token generation.
    - Ensure the security services follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

9. **Implement Email Validation**
    - Implement email validation logic in the domain model or as a separate service.
    - Ensure the validation logic follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

10. **Handle Error Messages**
    - Implement error handling and messaging for failed registration and login attempts.
    - Ensure error messages are user-friendly and follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

11. **Write Unit Tests**
    - Write unit tests for domain models, use cases, and controllers.
    - Ensure tests cover all business rules and edge cases.

12. **Write Integration Tests**
    - Write integration tests to ensure the entire registration and authentication flow works correctly.
    - Ensure tests cover interactions between different layers of the application.

13. **Document the API**
    - Create API documentation for the registration and login endpoints.
    - Ensure the documentation is clear and concise for end-users.
