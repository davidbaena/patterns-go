# Go Design Patterns and Concurrency

This repository is dedicated to demonstrating the use of design patterns and concurrency in Go.

## Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you
can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. They are about reusable designs and interactions of
objects.

### Types of Design Patterns

The design patterns can be classified into three categories:

1. **Creational Patterns**: These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic,
   rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which
   objects need to be created for a given use case.

2. **Structural Patterns**: These design patterns concern class and object composition. They help ensure that when one
   part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn't need to do the same. They also help in recasting
   parts of the system which don't fit a particular purpose into those that do.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

## Concurrency in Go

Concurrency is a big part of Go. It's supported at the language level, which means it's easier to understand and use
correctly than in languages where it's offered through libraries.

In Go, you can use goroutines to run functions concurrently. Channels then provide a way for these functions to
communicate and synchronize. This model of concurrency allows you to write systems that efficiently use all available
CPU cores and handle many tasks at the same time.

## Conclusion

This repository aims to provide clear examples and explanations of design patterns and concurrency in Go. It's a great
resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of Go and software design in general.
