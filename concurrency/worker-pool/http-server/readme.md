# Worker Pool Pattern in Go

## Overview

The **Worker Pool** pattern is a concurrency design pattern used in computer programming. It involves creating a pool of
worker goroutines that can execute tasks concurrently.

## How it Works

- **Task Dispatching**: Tasks are sent to the workers through a channel.
- **Task Execution**: The workers pick up tasks from the channel as they become available. Each worker is waiting and
  ready to handle an incoming task.

## Use Case: Web Server Request Handling

Consider a high-traffic web server handling incoming HTTP requests. Handling each request in a serial manner would not
be efficient and could lead to high latency for the end users.

When the web server starts, it could launch a pool of worker goroutines. Each worker is waiting and ready to handle an
incoming request. When a request comes in, it is dispatched to a worker in the pool. The worker handles the request and
then goes back to waiting for the next one.

This allows the server to handle multiple requests concurrently, greatly increasing throughput and reducing latency. It
also provides a level of abstraction between the task of handling a request and the mechanism of concurrency.
